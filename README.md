### Hi there 👋

<!--
**Timothep/Timothep** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🔭 I’m currently connecting people, asking _"did you talk with Bob?"_ or suggesting _"you should talk to Bob!"_... poor Bob. Bob, if you can read this... I'm sorry.
- 🎤 I host the [DevJourney Podcast](https://devjourney.info) and listen to the life stories of my fantastic guests 😍!
- 🌱 I’m currently sharpening my remote coaching and remote Engineering Management skills, growing into Developer Relations... oh and improving my Python accent 🐍
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on mentoring
- 💬 Ask me about mentoring, public speaking, podcasting, engineering management, being an advocate for your product/company?
- 📫 How to reach me: [@timothep](https://twitter.com/timothep) on Twitter
