### Hi there 👋

<!--
**Timothep/Timothep** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🔭 I’m currently connecting people, asking _"did you talk with Bob?"_ or suggesting _"you should talk to Bob!"_... poor Bob. Bob, if you can read this... I'm sorry. I also continue to host the [DevJourney Podcast](https://devjourney.info)
- 🌱 I’m currently sharpening my remote coaching and remote Engineering Management skills, growing into Developer Relations... oh and improving my Python accent 🐍
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on mentoring
- 💬 Ask me about mentoring, public speaking, podcasting and engineering management
- 📫 How to reach me: @timothep on Twitter
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
